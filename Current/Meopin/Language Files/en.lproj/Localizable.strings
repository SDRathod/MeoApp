Your personal opinion is protected by fundamental laws. Facts, however, must be proven in doubt, which is not always possible.\n\n2. Differentiate your score! Assign the notes in the individual categories, regardless of the overall impression! If, for example, you were dissatisfied with the clarification and treatment, the treating physician may nevertheless have been kind. Often the credibility of all categories is marked with the grade 1 or 6. Also try to describe different aspects of your provider's visit (eg waiting times, appointment, treatment ...). Do not attribute Only grade 6 or grade 1. Assess each category differently based on experience.\n\n3. Refrain from insults! Do not write \"The doctor is a complete idiot.\" Your assessment should be balanced and fair. Please make sure that your criticism is not offensive and generalizing. Sneaks are not accepted!\n\n4. Do not profit from the fact that comments are published on an anonymous basis. Even if you are able to publish on an anonymous basis, do not be more negative and do not leave unreasonable comments.
